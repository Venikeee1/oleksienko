            'To do this, we examined the geolocation of the site on the larger scale. In the center of the scheme, we placed the Source - the Sun and marked the sector of its influence. The main feature is that on the south side there is a long neighboring site. And in the northern direction a magnificent view opens - we look at the crowns of age-old trees. Schematically we marked the priority directions. In this project the power of Imagination is the priority. All the windows are facing the side with a breathtaking view. That’s why we’re paying so much attention to the energy saving and energy efficient solutions.'
